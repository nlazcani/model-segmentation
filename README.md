Script for testing a model segmentation for 3d printable molds

## TODO list

- [x] Get candidate points for the direction
- [x] Select all the vertex visibles in that direction
- [x] Same in the oposite direction
- [x] Make vertex groups in the mesh
- [x] Get a list for each polygons with the neighbors polygons
- [x] Group polygons by similar orientation and proximity
- [ ] Apply this groups in the visibles process
- [ ] Get a new vertex group with this new neighbor groups
